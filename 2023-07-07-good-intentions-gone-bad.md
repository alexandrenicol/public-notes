- [Sara Soueidan's website](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/)
- "Alt attribute can be an empty string for decorative images"
- "Alt attribute should describes the action, not the image, if clicking on the image triggers an action."
- Talk by Ian Pouncey: [How to make an inaccessible website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVxk3J0OH4)
- WebAIM Million: "96.3% of home pages had detected WCAG 2 failures!" https://webaim.org/projects/million/
- Write user stories for accessibility: "As a user using a screen reader, I want ..., so that ...".
- "You cannot out-code bad designs"
- Workshop idea: "Make people create an account on their favourite website using only the keyboard or a screen reader".
